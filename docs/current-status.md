# Current Status

Status: v0.3.2 pentest passed; awaiting green GitHub checks and tag authorization

Brynja still has no TLS, cryptographic, PKI, QUIC, DTLS, platform, or legacy
protocol implementation. The Rust workspace remains package scaffolding and
must not be used to secure network traffic. Brynja is not FIPS 140-3 validated,
and no package, feature, build, profile, or configuration may imply otherwise.

Signed releases v0.1.0 through v0.3.1 established the workspace, hardened
release and isolation controls, made standards authority executable, and
classified the complete protocol-surface inventory. The v0.3.2 candidate
advances only `brynja`; unchanged supporting crates remain at their
independently published `0.1.0` versions and are not selected again.

Version 0.3.0 provides the exact source foundation:

- 103 locked RFCs and eight local NIST authorities map to lifecycle, domain,
  and roadmap ownership;
- RFC status and update/obsolescence relationships are closed or explicitly
  excluded;
- eight exact IANA XML snapshots preserve registry state;
- all 285 official errata have fail-closed reviewed dispositions; and
- ordinary checks reproduce the ledger offline while the release gate rejects
  live official-source drift.

Version 0.3.1 adds explicit protocol-surface decisions:

- 45 semantic decisions cover current and compatibility TLS, DTLS, QUIC-TLS,
  PKIX, OCSP, CT, HPKE, ECH, cryptographic algorithms, certificate and key
  formats, legacy protocols, and operational facilities;
- all 192 nested registries and all 4,106 individual records across the eight
  pinned IANA collections receive a deterministic disposition;
- every one of the 4,343 total surfaces records normative sources, owning
  milestone, planned code target, planned test target, and rationale;
- required exclusions explicitly cover Heartbeat, status_request_v2,
  production SSLKEYLOGFILE, TLS 1.3 post-handshake authentication,
  certificate-with-external-PSK, legacy PKCS1 client signatures, ML-KEM PKIX
  credentials, HPKE non-base modes, and unsigned X.509 certificates;
- QUIC version-specific cryptography and certificate compression remain
  explicit bounded future work, while unknown extensions are safely ignored
  only where protocol rules permit; and
- 25 positive and broken-fixture tests reject source-ledger drift, registry
  omissions, duplicate or unknown decisions, invalid owners or targets,
  overlapping rules, unmatched overrides, stale output, and premature
  implementation claims.

Version 0.3.2 adds the normative-requirement foundation:

- 12 stable pilot requirements bind exact source-ledger and surface-register
  hashes, source sections and anchors, status, errata, strength, applicability,
  decisions, owners, residual risk, targets, tests, and evidence;
- all eight lifecycle states are represented: planned, implemented, tested,
  evidenced, rejected, caller-owned, legacy, and blocked;
- deterministic schema, matrix, coverage, and bidirectional source, decision,
  owner, target, test, and evidence indexes are reproduced byte for byte;
- implementation, test, and evidence claims require existing file anchors,
  while protocol requirements are forbidden from making premature
  implementation claims; and
- 51 positive and broken-fixture tests reject source or registry drift,
  malformed or duplicate identifiers, invalid sections, obsolete-as-current
  authority, illegal transitions, missing ownership and targets, premature
  evidence, weakened SHOULD decisions, symlink target escapes, released-ID
  removal, stale revisions, unrelated decision links, protocol use of global
  mappings, released-scope changes, lifecycle/disposition conflict, and stale
  generated output.

This remains governance and planning evidence, not protocol implementation.
The pilot proves the representation and failure behavior; v0.3.3 through
v0.3.5 populate the remaining normative requirements before protocol work
begins. Concrete ECDHE-ML-KEM groups remain blocked until both a final
Standards Track RFC and final IANA values exist.

No `brynja-sanitization` package or dependency exists yet; its admission
decision remains gated at v0.11.1.

The repository owner's first pentest reported no exploitable vulnerability and
one optional defense-in-depth improvement. Target validation now resolves
paths and rejects symlinks that escape the repository root. The subsequent
retest found two medium release-assurance defects: lifecycle transitions and
revisions were not bound to immutable history, and decision links could be
structurally valid but semantically unrelated. Both are remediated locally with
immutable parent-matrix comparison, append-only identifiers, exact revision
rules, explicit mapping scopes, source/disposition/owner consistency, and 16
dedicated history and semantic-link tests. A later retest found one remaining
medium bypass: protocol rows could select reviewed-global and avoid
exact-source checks. Reviewed-global is now governance-only, released scope is
immutable, and the two affected RFC-wide protocol pilot rows now use exact
IANA sources at revision three. Ordinary CI now accepts only the exact current,
committed `RETEST REQUIRED`/`PENDING` remediation state so hosted checks can
run truthfully before retest, while all release and tag paths require
`PASS`/`PASS`. The final repository-owner retest passed with zero open
findings. Tag authorization remains blocked until the committed candidate is
green on GitHub.
