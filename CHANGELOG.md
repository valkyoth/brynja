## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Security-first, dependency-free, `no_std` workspace foundation.
- Modern and legacy protocol package boundaries.
- Standards provenance, toolchain, platform, and release planning policies.
- Guarded independent-version crates.io planning and dependency-order
  publication with mandatory facade releases.
- Committed per-version pentest reports that must stay synchronized with every
  later release-candidate fix before green CI and explicit tagging.
- Versioned admission and conditional implementation stops for one optional
  protocol-neutral `brynja-sanitization` downstream adapter, with no
  `zeroize`, third-party activated dependency, facade, engine, or FIPS-module
  path.
